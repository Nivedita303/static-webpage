                A Tesla delegation including members of Tesla’s Responsible Sourcing Committee visited suppliers in the DRC and Argentina. Both trips included visits to mine sites and meetings with community representatives. In the DRC, Tesla also visited a school, an
                orphanage and a maternity clinic. Aside from contributing to Tesla’s environmental and social risk assessments, the trips helped Tesla better understand local contexts and challenges. The DRC trip provided a more nuanced view of the complex
                issue of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and its history within the DRC. In Argentina, the trip focused on questions related to water usage and the use of new technologies to extract lithium in a more energy-efficient way.
